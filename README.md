# Procedural cave generation with cellular automata

## Intro :
This is a program to procedurally generate cave systems with cellular automata<br/>
This program is written [LuaJIT](https://luaJIT.org) and runs on the [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org) game engine<br/>

## Controls :
* Click at the left side of the screen or press **n** to generate a new cave
* Click at the right side of the screen or press **s** to apply the cellular automata rules on the cave

## Information :
I learnt the process from [this tutorial](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/generate-random-cave-levels-using-cellular-automata--gamedev-9664)<br/>
